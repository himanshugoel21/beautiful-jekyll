# The Compound Effect Summary :)

_Darren Hardy’s compound effect_ is one of the most important book that I read again and again to remind myself of the tools and techniques Darren teaches. The techniques are so simple yet so effective.<br>

As Darren Says:

> You don’t make $ 200,000 a year spending two hours a day on the Internet, or lose 30 pounds in a week.

Therefore, you have to work towards your goals every single day. This book won’t teach you anything new or give you a magic pill. This book will re-visit the basic ideas which you are already aware of.

Let us dive into the summary of this book.

# Chapter 1: The Compound Effect In Action

> You know that expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies and gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why? Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest.

> I’ll win because of the positive habits I’ve developed, and because of the consistency I use in applying those habits.

## Definition:

1\.1 - “The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices.”

1\.2 - Even though results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don’t feel significant. Use these small subtle changes to improve your health, relationships, finances, goals or anything else that matters.

1\.3 - Realize that small seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference. Remember this formula:

## Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = Radical Difference

## Example:

**Step 1**: Go to Settings.<br>
**Step 2**: Tap on Mobile networks.<br>
**Step 3**: Look for _VoLTE_ option and turn on _VoLTE_ Mode.

**NOTE:** Also make sure that your device's firmware is up to date (including the one that should be able to turn on _VoLTE_.)

<h3>Hard Reset & Wipe:</h3>
Make sure your device is charged more than 60%.<br>

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  This step would erase the data present on your phone, I would strongly recommend to make a backup of your personal data before proceeding.

**Step 1**: Turn off your device.<br>
**Step 2**: Press and hold _Power_ and _Volume Down_ Button<br>
**NOTE:** Other common button combinations are<br>

* Nexus devices - Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power
* Samsung devices - Volume Up, Home, and Power
* Moto devices - Volume Down and Power
* Other devices generally use Volume Down and Power. Some devices with physical user interfaces may use the Power and Home buttons.<br>

**Step 3**: When you are in _Recovery Menu_, look for _wipe data/factory reset_, use Volume keys to navigate and Power Key to select.<br>
**Step 4**: Similarly, look for _wipe cache partition_, after performing both wipes, Reboot phone. <br>

**NOTE:** If _VoLTE_ icon in the status bar is still not visible then probably _Vodafone_ need to enable _VoLTE_ for you from their backend, for that follow these steps:<br>

<h3>Get VoLTE Enabled From Backend by Vodafone:</h3>

Sometimes _Vodafone_ needs to enable the _VoLTE_ service on your number from their backend, in order to generate a request you can follow these steps:

* Call **198** (toll-free) from your registered _Vodafone_ number or call _Vodafone Care_ on **+91 9811098110** (if you live in Delhi, otherwise please check the number online for your circle) from any phone.<br>

* Write a mail to _Vodafone_ on **vodafonecare.del@vodafone.com**, if you live in Delhi. Otherwise please check the mail address online for your circle.

You might get a reply something similar to this:

I hope these steps would help you enable _VoLTE_ on your number if there is any other concern, I would advise you to visit the _Vodafone Store_ near you.

Thank you for reading.
