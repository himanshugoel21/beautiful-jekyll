# The Compound Effect Summary

*Darren Hardy’s compound effect* is one of the most important book that I read again and again to remind myself of the tools and techniques Darren teaches. The techniques are so simple yet so effective.<br>

As Darren Says:

> You don’t make $ 200,000 a year spending two hours a day on the Internet, or lose 30 pounds in a week.

Therefore, you have to work towards your goals every single day. This book won’t teach you anything new or give you a magic pill. This book will re-visit the basic ideas which you are already aware of.

Let us dive into the summary of this book.

# Chapter 1: The Compound Effect In Action

> You know that expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies and gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why? Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest.

> I’ll win because of the positive habits I’ve developed, and because of the consistency I use in applying those habits.

## Definition:

1.1 - “The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices.”

1.2 - Even though results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don’t feel significant. Use these small subtle changes to improve your health, relationships, finances, goals or anything else that matters.

1.3 - Realize that small seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference. Remember this formula:

## Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = Radical Difference

## Example:



__Step 1__: Go to Settings.<br>
__Step 2__: Tap on Mobile networks.<br>
__Step 3__: Look for *VoLTE* option and turn on *VoLTE* Mode.

__NOTE:__ Also make sure that your device's firmware is up to date (including the one that should be able to turn on *VoLTE*.)

<h3>Hard Reset & Wipe:</h3>
Make sure your device is charged more than 60%.<br>

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__  This step would erase the data present on your phone, I would strongly recommend to make a backup of your personal data before proceeding.


__Step 1__: Turn off your device.<br>
__Step 2__: Press and hold *Power* and *Volume Down* Button<br>
__NOTE:__ Other common button combinations are<br>
* Nexus devices - Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power
* Samsung devices - Volume Up, Home, and Power
* Moto devices - Volume Down and Power
* Other devices generally use Volume Down and Power. Some devices with physical user interfaces may use the Power and Home buttons.<br>

__Step 3__: When you are in *Recovery Menu*, look for *wipe data/factory reset*, use Volume keys to navigate and Power Key to select.<br>
__Step 4__: Similarly, look for *wipe cache partition*, after performing both wipes, Reboot phone. <br>

__NOTE:__ If *VoLTE* icon in the status bar is still not visible then probably *Vodafone* need to enable *VoLTE* for you from their backend, for that follow these steps:<br>

<h3>Get VoLTE Enabled From Backend by Vodafone:</h3>

Sometimes *Vodafone* needs to enable the *VoLTE* service on your number from their backend, in order to generate a request you can follow these steps:

* Call __198__ (toll-free) from your registered *Vodafone* number or call *Vodafone Care* on __+91 9811098110__ (if you live in Delhi, otherwise please check the number online for your circle) from any phone.<br>

* Write a mail to *Vodafone* on __vodafonecare.del@vodafone.com__, if you live in Delhi. Otherwise please check the mail address online for your circle.

I hope these steps would help you enable *VoLTE* on your number if there is any other concern, I would advise you to visit the *Vodafone Store* near you.

Thank you for reading.
